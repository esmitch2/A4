    <h2>Proposition: North America is disproportionately contributing to carbon emissions.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Decision:</b> Using the outline of a human figure
					<br><b>Deceptive/Earnest Score:</b> -0.5
					<br><b>Rationale:</b> The choice to use human figures plays on emotional appeal by visualizing people, which can make the viewer more personally connected to the data. While the human figure is not inherently deceptive, it does encourage an emotional response rather than purely analytical thinking. The decision to use this design is aimed at enhancing persuasion through empathy, but it does slightly skew the visualization toward emotional appeal.
				</li>

				<li><b>Decision:</b> Sizing and layout of figures (North America vs. other regions)
					<br><b>Deceptive/Earnest Score:</b> -2
					<br><b>Rationale:</b> The dramatic difference in size between the North American figure and the smaller figures representing other regions is intentionally misleading. By distorting the scale, the visualization exaggerates North America’s contribution to emissions, which emotionally reinforces the message that North America is disproportionate. This choice sacrifices accuracy for impact, creating a highly persuasive yet deceptive visual. There is also some intentional ambiguity left in the design – is one North American equal to one of the corresponding rows, or all of them summed together? This could have been clarified, but was left intentionally vague to better support the narrative.
				</li>
				
				<li><b>Decision:</b> Per capita scaling of household data
					<br><b>Deceptive/Earnest Score:</b> 1.5
					<br><b>Rationale:</b> The decision to scale the data per capita is an earnest attempt to offer a more equitable and comparable way of assessing emissions across regions. This method ensures the data is presented with a focus on individual responsibility rather than total emissions, which makes the comparison more meaningful and accurate. The choice to limit emissions data to just household emissions, not industry emissions, also helps to better support the claim that this is representative of average North Americans and not the continent as a whole.
				</li>

				<li><b>Decision:</b> Inclusion of the proportional emissions over time chart at the bottom
					<br><b>Deceptive/Earnest Score:</b> 0.5
					<br><b>Rationale:</b> The chart effectively conveys emissions above and below population proportionality using red (bad) and grey (neutral) colors with a legend directly to the right of the plot. These design decisions feel intuitive without being misleading, and would get a more positive earnest score. However, the overlayed text interpretation of the chart leaves little room for viewers to draw their own conclusions. While the language used is neutral and factual, it still guides the viewer toward a specific interpretation. This diminishes the opportunity for independent analysis, which slightly tips the balance toward a more persuasive (but less neutral) visualization.
				</li>

				<li><b>Decision:</b> Including data sources and explaining emissions measurements
					<br><b>Deceptive/Earnest Score:</b> 2
					<br><b>Rationale:</b> Providing data sources and explaining the emissions measurement at the bottom of the chart increases the credibility of the visualization. This decision is completely earnest, as it aligns with best practices for transparent data visualization. Including citations and methodologies ensures the viewer trusts the data and adds legitimacy to the message being conveyed.

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li><b>Decision: </b>Summing both household and industry data
					<br><b>Deceptive/Earnest Score: </b>-1.5
					<br><b>Rationale: </b>Including both household and industry data for Asia is problematic because Asia’s emissions are heavily influenced by its role as the world’s manufacturing hub. By combining these data points, the visualization unfairly places the blame for global emissions on Asia, without accounting for the outsized role of the global supply chain. This is a deceptive choice, as it oversimplifies the narrative and shifts responsibility away from other regions, particularly North America.
				</li>

				<li><b>Decision: </b>Color scale (particularly the inclusion of green)
					<br><b>Deceptive/Earnest Score: </b>-2
					<br><b>Rationale: </b>The use of green to represent lower emissions is highly deceptive, as green is generally associated with positive or "good" outcomes. In the context of emissions, this choice misleads the viewer into thinking that certain regions with lower emissions are somehow doing better, obscuring the reality that all emissions are bad at any level. A yellow-to-red gradient would have been more appropriate to accurately convey severity.
				</li>

				<li><b>Decision: </b>Splitting the Americas but keeping Asia as a monolith
					<br><b>Deceptive/Earnest Score: </b>-2
					<br><b>Rationale: </b>By splitting the Americas into distinct regions but lumping all of Asia together as a single block, the visualization disproportionately magnifies the impact of Asia. This design decision implies that Asia is a singular entity responsible for emissions, without considering the regional diversity within Asia itself. This strategy is misleading and distorts the narrative, focusing on a monolithic view of Asia while downplaying the emissions contributions of other regions.
				</li>

				<li><b>Decision: </b>Geographic display, using area of countries to represent emissions
					<br><b>Deceptive/Earnest Score: </b>-1
					<br><b>Rationale: </b>Using geographic area to represent emissions is misleading, as it ignores population size, which is a more meaningful way to measure per capita emissions. This design decision plays on the assumption that larger countries are automatically worse in terms of emissions, which obscures the reality of population density and consumption patterns. The map thus provides a distorted view of emissions responsibility, aligning more with geographic size than population impact.
				</li>

				<li><b>Decision: </b>Callout plots to highlight North America and Asia
					<br><b>Deceptive/Earnest Score: </b>-0.5
					<br><b>Rationale: </b>The callouts at the bottom of the map are designed to direct the viewer’s attention to North America versus Asia. The accompanying text explicitly guides the interpretation of the data, leading viewers toward a specific conclusion instead of allowing them to form their own insights, which subtly influences their perception. However, the text itself remains factual. The scale used in the charts is consistent, which is a more neutral design choice and ensures some fairness in the presentation. The decision to only highlight North America and Asia was intentional, focusing the viewer’s attention on these two regions to cast North America in a more positive light. If other regions, like Africa and Oceania, had been included, North America would not have appeared as favorable in comparison, given that it has higher emissions than those regions.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

	  <p>While creating these visualizations, I found the act of creating something persuasive to be fairly straightforward. In contrast, defining what about these persuasive elements was deceptive or ethical was incredibly hard. At different points, I was able to convince myself that each decision I made was both fully earnest and fully deceptive, and I find myself unable to confidently draw a concrete line about what is an acceptable choice. Reflecting on this assignment has me grappling with three main questions:</p>

	  <p><b>Are appeals to emotion inherently deceptive?</b> In my first visualization, I used the human-shaped figures to appeal emotionally. This decision, while emotionally charged, raised the question of whether using emotions in visualizations is inherently deceptive or if it's simply a valid, persuasive tool. I initially categorized anything that appealed to emotions as deceptive and anything that relied on logic or credibility as earnest, but this distinction doesn’t fully capture the nuances of ethical visualization. I found myself thinking about our class discussion on Data Feminism—specifically the challenges of defining ethical visualizations. Much like in our class discussion, I struggled to pinpoint where the line is between what’s ethically acceptable and what’s misleading.</p>
	  
	  <p><b>Is applying my own ethical belief inherently deceptive?</b> For the “against” visualization, I chose to present emissions by country in their more raw form, knowing full well that such a portrayal overlooks the critical factor of population size—something I believe makes a significant difference in how emissions should be analyzed. I could justify this by saying that viewers should educate themselves on the global context and population disparities, but I also know that by not addressing this, I’m making it easier for viewers to misinterpret the message. I find myself torn between my personal belief that per capita emissions are the more ethical and transparent way to approach this issue, and the realization that others may not share the same view. Even though the data I presented is accurate, the visualization feels misleading because of the choice not to scale it per capita.</p>
	  
	  <p><b>Is including data sources just an excuse?</b> The aspect of the project I originally felt most confident about ethically was citing data sources. Providing transparency and giving viewers the opportunity to verify the data seemed like a solid step toward ensuring credibility. But even that raises questions—am I absolving myself of responsibility by offering the data source? It feels like a way to enhance credibility, but it also serves as a potential defense against criticism. I wonder how many viewers would actually take the time to verify the sources, or whether they would simply trust the citation as a sign of credibility, just as I usually do when encountering visuals online. In this way, the citation itself might be a subtle form of manipulation, intended to inspire trust while avoiding deeper scrutiny.</p>
	  
	  <p>Ultimately, I don’t think there is an absolute answer when it comes to ethical analysis and visualization. The dichotomy of labeling all of my decisions as either earnest or deceptive feels too simplistic. The lines between persuasion and deception are blurry, and I believe that a "neutral" stance is not always possible in data visualization. Ultimately, the ethicality of a visualization may depend on one’s values and the story they intend to tell. If a visual is effective in convincing its audience of a particular narrative, does that make it inherently deceptive? Or is it simply a well-crafted, persuasive tool? I’m not sure where the line is, but I’ve learned that reality doesn’t exist in absolutes—only in perspectives.</p>
